<p>Today was a good day.  I got up early, had a delicious breakfast of unbuttered toast and half of a grapefruit with some runny eggs.</p>

<p>I did some writing after breakfast, also. Here's a sample:</p>
<p>
  <span class="nice-to-know">All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.</span>
</p>

<p>Pretty good, right?</p>

<p>In the afternoon I took a walk in the hedge maze.  <span class="important">Voices of souls long dead, screaming in their eternal horror, sounded in the murky corners of my brain, begging for release from their unending torment.</span> I could do nothing for them.</p>

<p>I wonder what Danny's up to.</p>
